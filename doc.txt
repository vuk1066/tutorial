/* When one component renders another component, 
this is what React refers to as the owner-ownee relationship, 
where the parent component is also called a composite component */

/* Refs are a way to reference an instance of 
a component from within our React application.
Refs don't work work with stateless function components*/

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

 use -> this.props.children to acces innerHTML or nested components of another component

Shader -> small program written in a C like language called Open GLShaderLanguage -> GLSL
Props -> meant to be passed into our components as static values or methods
State -> is a collection of values that's meant to be managed by our components itself
Class component v. Stateless function -> a class can have state
Refs don't work with stateless function components. (=> use class)

{return (<h1> Hello </h1>);} -> jsx
{return React.createElement('h1',null,'Hello')} -> js

mounting and unmounting the component -> when a component is added or removed from the DOM

When we want to access the innerHTML or nested components of another component, we can use this.props.children in React. This is very similar to Angular 1's transclusion or Ember's yield or Web Component's content.

componentWillMount()
componentDidMount()
componentWillUnmount()
componentWillReceiveProps()
shouldComponentUpdate() => does not prevent state change only prevents re-rendering
